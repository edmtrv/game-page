        Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar
        Games. It
        is the first main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series since 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV. Set within the
        fictional state
        of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story follows three criminals and their efforts
        to
        commit heists while under pressure from a government agency. The open world design lets players freely roam San
        Andreas'
        open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.
